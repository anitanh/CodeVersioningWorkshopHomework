Summary of Branching

Using branch we can have a separate workspace using our original code as a base and modify it as we need without changing the original code. 
When we are confident with your changes then we can merge the code from the branch into original code.

Branch also allows us to work on different thing in parallel without disrupting the original code.
Branching is also useful to work with others in the same repository.
