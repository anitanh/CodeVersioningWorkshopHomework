# CodeVersioningWorkshopHomework

This is a homework assignment repository for Code Versioning Workshop.

The Workshop covers introduction to git, basic git command and the usefulness of using git to keep the changes that we made in our work so that we can jump in between changes when needed.
Git is also useful because we can collaborate with the people in our team to develop the repository, such as using Github. Using remote repository, we can collaborate to anyone since the repository is accessible anywhere as long as you have internet.

Some git commands that's covered during the workshop are initializing git, versioning, branching, and merging. 

The workshop is fun and interesting while also easy to understand.
